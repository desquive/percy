                            I thought the <a class="embedded effect" href="https://code.org/" target="_blank">code.org</a> lessons in 3rd grade had ruined my chances of ever seriously programming. 
                            Funny how now it’s basically become my life as a third-year computer science student at USC. As a 
                            First Generation student born of Mexican parents, I am beyond grateful for the opportunity and 
                            blessing to study the great field of tech.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            My main priorities these days aside from my studies are my positions as Director of Software 
                            Engineering for <a href="https://trojantechsolutions.org/" target="_blank" class="embedded effect">Trojan Tech Solutions</a>, 
                            Student Ambassador and Community Life and Culture Chair at 
                            the <a class="embedded effect" href="https://www.catholictrojan.org/" target="_blank">USC Caruso Catholic Center</a>, and my non-existent solo drumming career. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            My main goals are to inspire young, black and hispanic students to pursue careers in Tech as well 
                            as emphasize the power of personality and a smile behind the computer screen. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            When I myself am not behind said screen, you can find me at a soccer field, beach volleyball court,
                            basketball court, or record store near you. Aside from playing sports and collecting music, I 
                            really enjoy playing the drums (whenever I can get my hands on a set)
                            and spending time with my friends and family, especially my little baby nephew, 
                            doing anything imaginable.

                                    As part of a research project during my senior year of high school, 
                                    this sound recognition system utilizes an open-source project found on Github that 
                                    resembles a Shazam algorithm in order to recognize sound and songs. 
                                    The scope of the linked research paper focuses on the use of the Raspberry Pi 4B device and 
                                    the described program to provide assistance and accommodations to deaf or hard of hearing people in their 
                                    own homes and the feasibility of its implementation.
